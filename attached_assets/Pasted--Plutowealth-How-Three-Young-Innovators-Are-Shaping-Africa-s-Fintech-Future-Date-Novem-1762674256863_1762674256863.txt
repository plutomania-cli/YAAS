### 💡 Origins and Mission

Plutowealth was born from the belief that technology can bridge the gap between financial education and financial empowerment. The founders — each deeply rooted in tech — began building intuitive digital tools designed to simplify concepts like saving, investing, and personal finance for everyday users.

“Our mission is to simplify financial literacy through innovation,” says **Joseph Soronadi**, a software engineer and founder of [Techminds Academy](https://techmindsacademy.org). “We want to make wealth management something everyone can learn, not just professionals.”
